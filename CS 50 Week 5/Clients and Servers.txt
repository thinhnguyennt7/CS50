IP: Interner protocol (IPV4)
Must have a unique address
IP has 4 parts. Those values are from 0 to 255.
The lowest : 0.0.0.0
The highest: 255.255.255.255
The max bit: 8 bits for 1 and 32 bits total

IPV6
8 parts: Those value are form 0 to 65,536
the max bit: 16 bit and 128 bits totals
2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8844 <=> 2001:4860:4860::8844

Private IP address:
10.#.#.#
172.16.#.# - 173.31.#.#
192.168.#.#


DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    The role is to assign IP addresses to devices

DNS: Domain Name System
    Translate domain names to IP addresses.

nslookup : look up IP address for particular server name.

traceroute : look the data able to send in the particular milisecond.

Access Point:
The router: the role is to connect all the devices and post back a same unique IP address exist on all devices.
The router is an public ip address. All the devices that connect to the routers are now have private ip address.

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol. a # the corespond the the server we are trying to send or recieve.
22 SSH
53 DNS
80 HTTP
443 HTPPS
587 SMTP : Simple mail transfer protocol

Example : curl - I http://harvard.edu:80/

PORTS:
When it send out to the web server, it will fill in with the random port number from 0 to 65000. That identify the unqiue port.

TCP/IP: 
    When we trying to download something like a picture from the internet. It will divided up into few different pieces. Then each of those piece will be located in different envelop
    TCP and IP: 2 features:
        1. IP ensure every computer on the internet that speaks this protocol has it address. So IP handles the getting on the data to some destination.
        2. TCP: ensure or guarantess with high probability delivery that the data actually get there. One those envelopes reach to the specific destination. And resend back to where it sent out.
